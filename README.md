What I implemented during or for my classes in Télécom ParisTech.

It's in French and you don't have the wording, sorry.

The comment_classification folder contains my code for a data challenge organized by one of our professors. In this challenge, using a machine learning library was forbidden, except for NLTK. The code is rather messy because I did it quite fast without taking the time to think about its structure.

Finally, all of it is quite old at my scale: it was written not later than June 2016, while I started Python in October 2015. I like to think I improved since then.
